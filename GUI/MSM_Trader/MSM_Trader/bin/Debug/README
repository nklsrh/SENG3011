V4.2
- Fixed some bugs (checks dates, negative numbers)

How to operate
1. Download module.jar and parameter.properties files
	- You can make your own parameter.properties file, but it must be formatted identically and have the same properties (see example file or below)
2. Put module.jar and parameter.properties in the same directory
3. Edit the parameter.properties file to accommodate the desired parameters
	- file= <- Put the filepath to the target CSV File. This must have .csv as its file extension.
		Format: FILEPATH/FILENAME.csv
		E.g. home/User/bhp15Feb.csv
	- timeFrameStart= <- Date and time to indicate the start of the time frame. If you do not wish to specify a start time, simply leave blank ("timeFrameStart="). If no date is specified it will start analysis from the beginning of the file.
		Format: yyyyMMdd,HH:mm:ss
		E.g. 20130205,00:00:00 denotes 5th Feb 2013, 12:00am
	- timeFrameEnd= <- Date and time to indicate the end of the time frame. If you do not wish to specify an end time, simply leave blank ("timeFrameEnd="). If no date is specified it will finish analysis when the end of the file is reached.
		Format: yyyyMMdd,HH:mm:ss
		E.g. 20130205,00:00:10 denotes 5th Feb 2013, 12am and 10 Seconds
	- movingAvg= <- An integer used to restrict the number of trades with which the Simple Moving Average (SMA) is calculated.
		Format: positive digits
		E.g. 4
	- threshold= <- A number used to indicate the threshold for which we determine the trade signal.
		Format: positive digits
		E.g. 0.0001
4. Open terminal and navigate to the directory containing the module.jar and parameter.properties files
5. Type "java -jar module.jar"
6. Output will appear in the same directory
	- The module typically outputs a log file and an orderbook. In certain cases (e.g. if an error occurs) a log file only will be produced.
	- The log file contains:
   - execution time
   - parameters used
   - details on success/failure of program
	- The orderbook contains the generated trade signals. Buys are ordered in descending order and sells ordered in ascending order. The orderbook will only be produced if valid signals are generated.

BUGS
- Greatly depends on format of csv file. Must be formatted in a certain way for it to work, e.g. prices must be contained in the fourth column, and dates and times in the second and third columns respectively.
- Currently does not allow program to be run from another directory. Must have directory of program and not current directory, e.g. java -jar /home/User/module.jar will not work.
